  "readme": "# New Relic Node.js agent\n\nThis package instruments your application for performance monitoring\nwith [New Relic](http://newrelic.com).\n\nThis is a beta release. You should probably try it in your staging or\ndevelopment environment first. If you would prefer to wait for the GA\nrelease, please [sign up](http://try.newrelic.com/nodejs) to be notified.\n\nMake sure you have a [New Relic account](http://newrelic.com) before\nstarting. To see all the features, such as slow transaction traces, you will\nneed a New Relic Pro subscription. Contact your New Relic representative to\nrequest a Pro Trial subscription during your beta testing.\n\n## Getting started\n\n1. [Install node](http://nodejs.org/#download). For now, at least 0.6 is\n   required. Some features (e.g. error tracing) depend in whole or in\n   part on features in 0.8 and above. Development work on the agent is\n   being done against the latest released non-development version of Node.\n2. Install this module via `npm install newrelic` for the application you\n   want to monitor.\n3. Copy `newrelic.js` from `node_modules/newrelic` into the root directory of\n   your application.\n4. Edit `newrelic.js` and replace `license_key`'s value with the license key\n   for your account.\n5. Add `require('newrelic');` as the first line of the app's main module.\n   *IMPORTANT*: formerly this was `require('newrelic_agent')`, and you *MUST*\n   update your code.\n\nIf you wish to keep the configuration for the agent separate from your\napplication, the agent will look for newrelic.js in the directory referenced\nby the environment variable `NEWRELIC_HOME` if it's set.\n\nWhen you start your app, the agent should start up with it and start\nreporting data that will appear within [the New Relic\nUI](https://rpm.newrelic.com/) after a few minutes. Because the agent\nminimizes the amount of bandwidth it consumes, it only reports data once a\nminute, so if you add the agent to tests that take less than a minute to run,\nthe agent won't have time to report data to New Relic. The agent will write\nits log to a file named `newrelic_agent.log` in the application directory. If\nthe agent doesn't send data or crashes your app, the log can help New Relic\ndetermine what went wrong, so be sure to send it along with any bug reports\nor support requests.\n\n## Configuring the agent\n\nThe agent can be tailored to your app's requirements, both from the server\nand via the newrelic.js configuration file you created. For more details on\nwhat can be configured, refer to\n[`lib/config.default.js`](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/blob/master/lib/config.default.js),\nwhich documents the available variables and their default values.\n\nIn addition, for those of you running in Heroku, Microsoft Azure or any other\nPaaS environment that makes it easier to control configuration via the your\nserver's environment, all of the configuration variables in newrelic.js have\ncounterparts that can be set in your service's shell environment. You can\nmix and match the configuration file and environment variables freely; the\nvalue found from the environment will always take precedence.\n\nThis documentation will be moving to New Relic's servers with the 1.0 release,\nbut for now, here's a list of the variables and their values:\n\n* `NEW_RELIC_HOME`: path to the directory in which you've placed newrelic.js.\n* `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`: The name of this application, for reporting to\n  New Relic's servers. This value can be also be a comma-delimited list of\n  names.\n* `NEW_RELIC_ENABLED`: Whether or not the agent should run. Good for\n  temporarily disabling the agent while debugging other issues with your\n  code.\n* `NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE`: Inhibit loading of the configuration file\n  altogether. Use with care. This presumes that all important configuration\n  will be available via environment variables, and some log messages\n  assume that a config file exists.\n* `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`: Your New Relic license key.\n* `NEW_RELIC_LOG`: Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including\n  the filename. The agent will shut down the process if it can't create\n  this file, and it creates the log file with the same umask of the\n  process. Setting this to `stdout` will write all logging to stdout, and\n  `stderr` will write all logging to stderr.\n* `NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging priority for the New Relic agent. Can be one of\n  `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`. `debug` and `trace` are\n  pretty chatty; unless you're helping New Relic figure out irregularities\n  with the agent, you're probably best off using `info` or higher.\n* `NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED`: Whether or not to trace errors within\n  your application. Values are `true` or `false`.\n* `NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES`: Comma-delimited list of HTTP\n  status codes to ignore. Maybe you don't care if payment is required?\n* `NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED`: Whether to collect and submit slow\n  transaction traces to New Relic. Values are `true` or `false`.\n* `NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD`: Millisecond duration at which\n  a transaction trace will count as slow and be sent to New Relic. Can\n  also be set to `apdex_f`, at which point it will set the trace threshold\n  to 4 times the current ApdexT.\n* `NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N`: Number of transaction traces to send to New\n  Relic on each 60-second harvest cycle. Defaults to 1. This can lead\n  to noisy transaction traces and should be used with care.\n* `NEW_RELIC_APDEX`: Set the initial Apdex tolerating / threshold value.\n  This is more often than not set from the server.\n* `NEW_RELIC_HOST`: Hostname for the New Relic collector proxy. You\n  shouldn't need to change this.\n* `NEW_RELIC_PORT`: Port number on which the New Relic collector proxy\n  will be listening.\n* `NEW_RELIC_DEBUG_METRICS`: Whether to collect internal supportability\n  metrics for the agent. Don't mess with this unless New Relic asks you to.\n* `NEW_RELIC_DEBUG_TRACER`: Whether to dump traces of the transaction tracer's\n  internal operation. You're welcome to enable it, but it's unlikely to be\n  edifying unless you're a New Relic Node.js engineer.\n\n## Recent changes\n\nInformation about changes to the agent are in NEWS.md.\n\n## Known issues & remaining work\n\nInformation about what's known to be broken and what's being worked on\nsoon is in TODO.md.\n\n## Support\n\nDuring the beta, our support bandwidth is limited. We cannot guarantee a\nspecific turn-around on questions and issues. However, we try to reply and\nresolve issues promptly and we *greatly* appreciate feedback about how to\nmake the product better.\n\nPlease [submit a ticket](https://support.newrelic.com) if you don't see the\ndata you expect, if the agent generates an error, if you have a feature that\nyou would like to see, or if you have a library that you would like\ninstrumented. In the ticket, please provide as much information as you can\nabout your application and the issue, including your `newrelic_agent.log`,\n`package.json` and app code snippets.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThe New Relic Node.js agent uses code from the following open source projects\nunder the following licenses:\n\n  bunyan                http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n\nThe New Relic Node.js agent itself is free-to-use, proprietary software.\nPlease see the full license (found in LICENSE in this distribution) for\ndetails.\n",
